## Hi there 👋
I am Samuel -a name that carries the quiet weight of a distant storm.I am melancholic, a seeker of meaning in the quiet spaces between thoughts.I have begun 
a new journey:learning programming.It's a path that feels both uncertain and full of possibility,like stepping into a world of logic and creativity.I'm excited
to explore this new chapter,one line of code at a time

## 🚀 What I’m Learning
Here are the technologies I’m currently studying:

- 🌐 **HTML5** – structuring web pages  
- 🎨 **CSS3** – styling and layouts  
- ⚡ **JavaScript** – adding interactivity  
- 🐍 **Python** – problem solving and automation basics  
- 🗄️ **Git & GitHub** – version control and collaboration

## 🛠️ My Current Project
### ✅ Beginner Project: To-Do List App
I’m working on a simple **To-Do List App** that lets users:
- ➕ Add new tasks  
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks  
- ❌ Delete completed tasks  
- 💾 Save tasks locally (so they don’t disappear on refresh)

This project helps me practice:
- DOM manipulation in **JavaScript** 🖱️  
- Working with **arrays & objects** 🗂️  
- Writing clean, beginner-friendly code ✨  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build **small projects** to apply my learning  
- Share progress regularly on GitHub 📝  
- Collaborate with other learners 🤝
